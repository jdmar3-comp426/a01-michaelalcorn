        <strong>Origin of Oni</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oni originates from the word "on" which means to "hide or conceal". Oni
        are able to hide and conceal themselves from most things. <br>
        Oni during the 10th century had a different meaning than they used to.
        The most wicked of individuals on Earth, transform into Oni when they
        die. <br>
        If you are even worse, then you turn into an Oni before you die which is
        where folktales of Oni come from.
